    <h1> Zurich Switzerland</h1>
    <p>Zurich (German: Z端rich; Alemannic German: Z端ri) is the largest city in Switzerland and the capital of
        the
        canton of Zurich. It is in north-central Switzerland, at the northwestern tip of Lake Zurich. As of December
        2024,
        the municipality had 448,664 inhabitants. The urban area was home to 1.45 million people (2020), while the
        Zurich
        metropolitan area had a total population of 2.1 million (2020). Zurich is a hub for railways, roads, and air
        traffic.
        Both Zurich Airport and Zurich's main railway station are the largest and busiest in the country.
    </p>
    <p>Evidence of early, sparse settlements in the area dates back more than 6,400 years, indicating human presence
        prior to
        the establishment of the town. Permanently settled for over 2,000 years, Zurich was eventually founded by the
        Romans,
        who called it Turicum. During the Middle Ages, Zurich gained the independent and privileged status of imperial
        immediacy
        and, in 1519, became a primary centre of the Protestant Reformation in Europe under the leadership of Huldrych
        Zwingli.</p>
