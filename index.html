            👋 Hey there! I'm Jerwin, a basketball enthusiast who loves the energy of the court just as much as the
            creativity of
            coding. 🏀
            I'm currently studying Web Design and Development, diving into the world of digital creation with the goal
            of building
            my own website from scratch. 💻
            As I grow in this field, I'm excited to be part of the software and IT industry, where innovation meets
            impact—and where
            I can carve out a meaningful career.
            One of my biggest aspirations is to find work with flexible hours, so I can stay present for my family and
            fulfill my
            church callings—because purpose, faith, and connection are at the heart of everything I do. 🙏
