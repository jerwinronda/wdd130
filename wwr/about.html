            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                White water rafting as a commercial activity traces its roots to the early 20th century, but many iconic
                rafting sites
                have deeper historical significance. One such site is the Snake River in Wyoming, where the first
                recorded attempt to
                navigate its wild waters occurred in 1811—earning it the nickname “Mad River” due to its treacherous
                rapids. In 1940,
                Clyde Smith led the first successful commercial rafting trip through the Snake River Canyon, using
                inflatable pontoon
                rafts inspired by military designs. This pioneering journey helped establish the river as a premier
                destination for
                adventure tourism. By the 1950s, float trips were offered at resorts like Jackson Lake Lodge, and by the
                1970s, rafting
                companies began forming across the U.S., transforming natural river corridors into thriving hubs for
                outdoor recreation.
                Today, sites like the Snake River continue to attract thrill-seekers, blending rugged history with
                modern eco-tourism.
